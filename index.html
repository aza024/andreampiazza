                        I'm an enthusiastic full-stack web developer with a goal to create meaningful web applications that are fun to use by focusing on user-centric design.  Let’s connect so we can talk about collaborating on an awesome project!

                <p class ="aboutpg2">
                    Since graduating from The State University of New York’s Polytechnic Institute in 2015, I worked as an application engineer for two years focusing on SQL and Magic/Unipaas. Although the back-end was facinating, I wanted to find a position that required more creativity. I moved from Connecticut to California to take General Assembly’s Web Development Immersive course where and love learning about web development because my interest in coding and design converge.

                <p class ="aboutpg3">  
                    I'm most productive when build applications that provide value to a company. I love solving problems, work well on a team, and independently. I learn quickly, work well on a team, and

                <p class ="aboutpg4">  
                    When not immersed in web development, I can be found looking for new ways to stay active in my new city of San Francisco. I’m happiest when I’m around family, friends, or someone I can learn from.
