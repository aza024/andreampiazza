                    I'm an enthusiastic full-stack web developer with a goal to create meaningful web applications that are fun to use by focusing on user-centric design.  Let’s connect so we can talk about how I can bring my passion my to your project!

            <p class ="aboutpg">
                Since graduating from The State University of New York’s Polytechnic Institute in 2015, I worked as an application engineer for two years focusing on SQL and Magic/Unipaas. Although the back-end was facinating, I wanted to find a position that required more creativity. I moved from Connecticut to California to take General Assembly’s Web Development Immersive course where and love learning about web development because my interest in coding and design converge.
            </p>  
            <p class ="aboutpg">  
                When not immersed in web development, I can be found looking for new ways to stay active in my new city of San Francisco. I’m happiest when I’m around family, friends, or someone I can learn from.
