## Technologies Used: 
-HTML

-CSS 

-Javascript 

-AWS Lambda for contact form 

## Takeaways: 
I learned that you can only use call process.env in JavaScript files. I was trying to use an enviroment variable in a .yml file for 
AWS' lambda to send an email from the contact form without using a server and ran into issues. Once I removed the enviroment variables
and hardcoded the values, the contact form worked.
